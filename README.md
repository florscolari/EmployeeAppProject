Data Persistence Approach
- Use of Room DB: local storage
- It has not been easy but I've chosen this approach to practice some basic concepts learned on previous subject
about create and handle queries to the database.
- Also to recreate the process end-to-end from UI elements, collect user inputs, store them on a database with attributes,
- and then retrieve that data for another purpose.
  
*This app was built following this tutorial to set the app architecture based on MVVM pattern.

me more challenges than advantages, but it helped me to start from somewhere instead of being in the dark at that first moment.

Then, each feature has been built to cover the requirements described in the assessment and having in mind 
this user persona:
As an HR Manager in a Warehouse & Logistic Solutions Company, 
I want to manage the team members from my phone, 
so that I can easily update details and enter new employees to the system wherever I am.
